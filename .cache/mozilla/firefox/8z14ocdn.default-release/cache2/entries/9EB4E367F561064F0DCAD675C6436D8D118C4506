The app helps Freshdesk users connect JIRA issues to Freshdesk tickets. This app will also let you sync ticket statuses and comments from JIRA directly to Freshdesk whenever a change is made. This real-time information sync ensures that both engineers and support teams have a 360 view of the ticket+issue, including customer expectations and ticket status.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the V2 version of the JIRA Freshdesk integrations, there have been some significant additions.  With this version of the JIRA integration you will be able to:\r\n1. Connect multiple JIRA accounts to your Freshdesk account\r\n2. Connect multiple JIRA issues to a Freshdesk ticket and also connect a JIRA issue to multiple Freshdesk tickets\r\n3. Customer Mapping: Customize JIRA columns that need to be shown in Freshdesk once the ticket is linked with JIRA\r\n4. Define agent roles to allow or restrict agents from deleting JIRA issues from tickets\r\n5. You can now search for JIRA issues by the ‘summary’ fields as well as the issue number\r\n6. Add tags to the Freshdesk ticket whenever a JIRA issue is created or linked so that it can be easier to filter, fetch and track issues in Freshdesk\r\n7. Edit comments on JIRA’s end and the updated comments can be viewed inside the Freshdesk ticket. This can be done one way for now\r\n8. Installing or updating this app automatically installs the “Freshdesk for JIRA” app in the Atlassian marketplace\r\n9. Map Freshdesk fields such as Source, Group, Agent, Freshdesk Ticket Number, Freshdesk Ticket URL, Customer Name, Customer Email Address, Customer Phone number, and Company Name to custom JIRA text fields\r\n\r\n(Note: To see Freshdesk ticket data in JIRA, install the 'Freshdesk for JIRA' app from Atlassian marketplace)\r\n\r\nThe JIRA Project Management app helps deliver complete customer service with the combined power of the JIRA tool with Freshdesk.  \r\n\r\nOnce the app is installed, it is rendered on the right side of the sidebar.

For instance, if the “Type” field of the ticket is set to, say, “technical query”, the “Group” field will display only those options that were preset by the user e.g. if “Dev team”, “L2 team” were the only two options selected by the user, any other option would not appear in the dropdown menu.  \r\n\r\nThe app lets you customize ticket fields on Ticket Details, New Ticket, and New Email pages.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\n----------------------\r\nWhen multiple rules are configured for the same target/destination fields, and all of the rules match the criteria, the final rule listed in the app settings will execute for the target field upon loading the TicketDetails page.\r\nFor example -  suppose there are three rules configured, and all of them match the criteria.\r\n\r\n1.

resolve a ticket faster. The Slack app for Freshdesk simplifies communication and allows your agents to collaborate with teams in your organization in a streamlined fashion.\r\n\r\nWith the Slack app for Freshdesk, you can:\r\n1. Deliver real-time notifications about new and updated tickets to public or private Slack channels using automation rules.\r\n2.  Use the Freshdesk “Create Ticket” slash command in Slack to convert conversations with peers and customers directly to Freshdesk tickets.\r\n3. Send Direct Messages (DMs) to agents about tickets that have been assigned or updated in their queue.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nWe’ve also partnered with Slack to build a Freshdesk app for Slack. The app allows you to sync ticket updates between a Freshdesk group and a Slack channel. Replies from internal teams come back into the ticket as private notes, making collaboration easier, and ensuring all context is recorded in one place.\r\n\r\nTo access the app, visit: https://slack.com/apps/AV2AU01M2-freshdesk-for-slack","short_description":null,"instructions":"For complete instructions visit - https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/206103-the-slack-app"}},"relevant_apps":[7656,17,1844,3534,1915,10,14,33133,27938,26680],"supported_locales":["de","en"],"updated_at":"2023-10-04T05:00:01.000Z","privacy_policy":"https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/","terms_of_service":null,"cloudtypes":["core","omnichannel"],"latest_version":{"id":94245,"version_number":"1.0","platform_version":"3.0","auto_updatable":false,"whats_new":null,"state":"live","features":[],"modules":["support_ticket"],"settings_url":null,"oauth_settings_url":null,"pricing":[],"actions":[],"events":[],"placeholders":[],"updated_at":"2021-09-15T06:11:21.000Z"},"rating":3.4,"ratings_count":44,"install_count":13914},{"id":3105,"name":"auto_start_timer","built_with":"fdk","type":"marketplace","sub_type":"default","subscription_type":"free","has_static_ip":false,"state":["live"],"video_link":"https://youtu.be/6SYldvz_bKY","published_at":"2023-09-12T17:42:59.000Z","products":["freshdesk"],"cover_arts":[{"name":"Webp.net_resizeimage__2_.png","resolutions":{"original":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_cover_art/original/Webp.net_resizeimage__2_.png"},"thumb":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_cover_art/thumb/Webp.net_resizeimage__2_.png"},"thumb2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_cover_art/thumb2x/Webp.net_resizeimage__2_.png"},"large":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_cover_art/large/Webp.net_resizeimage__2_.png"},"large2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_cover_art/large2x/Webp.net_resizeimage__2_.png"}}}],"publisher":{"name":null,"product_account_id":562787,"support_email":"spritlesupport@freshworks.com","alternate_email":"fw-support@spritle.com","support_url":"https://saasly.in/contact-us"},"categories":[{"id":83,"name":"Agent Productivity","type":"global"},{"id":92,"name":"Payments, Accounting & Billing","type":"global"}],"screenshots":[{"name":"1.png","resolutions":{"original":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/original/1.png"},"thumb":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/thumb/1.png"},"thumb2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/thumb2x/1.png"},"large":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/large/1.png"},"large2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/large2x/1.png"}}},{"name":"2.png","resolutions":{"original":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/original/2.png"},"thumb":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/thumb/2.png"},"thumb2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/thumb2x/2.png"},"large":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/large/2.png"},"large2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/large2x/2.png"}}},{"name":"3.png","resolutions":{"original":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/original/3.png"},"thumb":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/thumb/3.png"},"thumb2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/thumb2x/3.png"},"large":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/large/3.png"},"large2x":{"dimension":"1024x1024","url":"https://d3h0owdjgzys62.cloudfront.net/images/5013/live_screenshot/large2x/3.png"}}}],"locale":{"texts":{"display_name":"Auto Start Timer","overview":"Get the exact time spent on tickets by the agent with the help of the Auto Start Timer app.","description":"It's important to track the time agents spend on their tickets.\r\n\r\nBecause we all know that \"support\" is a crucial term in the business manual. \r\nWith this app, you can track the time precisely for a ticket, and you will know what's stopping you from providing the best solution that your customers deserve. \r\n\r\nHere you can customize the start and stop statuses for the timer based on your business workflow.
